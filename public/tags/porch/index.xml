      <description>One of the great things about moving back to West Virginia from Oklahoma was the ability to sit on the porch. In Oklahoma, we had a sun room, but it sat low to the ground and wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly big. In addition, when you live in the south plains, porch time is limited because of the heat that hangs around for a good six months per year.
When I was growing up, my grandfather and his brother were close.</description>
