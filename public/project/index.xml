      <description>One of the great things about moving back to West Virginia from Oklahoma was the ability to sit on the porch. In Oklahoma, we had a sun room, but it sat low to the ground and wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly big. In addition, when you live in the south plains, porch time is limited because of the heat that hangs around for a good six months per year.
When I was growing up, my grandfather and his brother were close.</description>

      <description>This is a long-term project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in award #1827494. With colleagues Deven Carlson, Elizabeth Bell, and Tracy Bark, the project explores how interest groups use research and data in argumentation about education policy. The project is unique in looking at proposed regulations and how groups craft arguments in the proposal development stage.
To do this, we examine a large dataset of public comments on education policies by paragraph&amp;mdash;over 90k comments.</description>
