      <description>This is a long-term project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in award #1827494. With colleagues Deven Carlson, Elizabeth Bell, and Tracy Bark, the project explores how interest groups use research and data in argumentation about education policy. The project is unique in looking at proposed regulations and how groups craft arguments in the proposal development stage.
To do this, we examine a large dataset of public comments on education policies by paragraph&amp;mdash;over 90k comments.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve spent an academic lifetime compiling original data sets, both in my work and as part of broader research teams. In doing so, I have become quite opinionated about the role of data in science, its collection, and its organization. In this post, I detail four principles of data collection and organization useful to any analyst needing to collect data, whether by hand or machine. Often, students, junior scholars, business analysts, and public managers engage in data collection.</description>
