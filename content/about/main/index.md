  I am a first generation college graduate originally from Fayette County, West Virginia. I am from the land between the rivers---[New River Gorge National Park](https://www.nps.gov/neri/index.htm) and [Gualey River National Recreation River](https://www.nps.gov/gari/index.htm)---the cradle of civilization as far as I am concerned. I am the Director of the [Institute for Policy Research and Public Affairs](https://www.rockefellerschool.wvu.edu/policy-research) at West Virginia University. Since you can find my professional persona over there, I won't load this site with a lot of professional material or academic jargon, *except in instances where I think something is really interesting.* 
  
  The [Hugo theme "Apéro"](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) for the this webpage was developed by Alison Presmanes Hill with help naming it from Maëlle Salmon. It is light-weight and a great theme for introducing yourself to the world. Thanks to the developers making life easier for the rest of us. The template describes the theme in their own words:
  
  *Apéro is a unique kind of casual get-together in French culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. A good apéro is one where you'd happily spend a few hours just hanging out.*
  
  Their description is fitting for what I hope this site to be, and I have kept a lot of defaults from the template.
  
  I have lived in Seattle, Washington, where I earned my Ph.D., Austin, Texas and Norman, Oklahoma. I loved all these places and experiences and have friends spread across the country. I currently live in the [South Park Historic District](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morgantown,+WV/@39.6351227,-79.9609749,10209m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88357b684185333d:0x78bee909ab8d43e4!8m2!3d39.629526!4d-79.9558968) in Morgantown, West Virginia. It is great to be back home.
  
  What will you find here? **Commentary** on life and culture in [Appalachia](https://www.arc.gov/about-the-appalachian-region/). Observations from my **travel** both in the US and abroad. I love **imbibing culture** in the US and other countries, so you'll find reviews of wine and beer, cocktail recipes, recommendations, and the general norms surrounding *a drink with friends, or even enemies.* As the *Booze Traveler* says,
  
  > "Sit down with a stranger and a couple of drinks, and the whole world opens up." --- Jack Maxwell, *Booze Traveler*
  
  You will also find commentary on public policy, data science, and the politics of rural areas. Sometimes I post <i class="fab fa-r-project" style="color:steelblue"></i> code for maps, data visualizations, or other types of analysis. Borrow code at your leisure, but `caveat emptor.`
  
  You'll find commentary on old things as well, especially maps and books. I adore libraries, including personal libraries, and cartography. Finally, there will be a tidbit here and there on a gentleman's attire.
